# SafetyNet

Developed as a CSE 3461: Networking Project

The object of this project is to develop a way for those who are disabled or otherwise in constant threat of medical emergencies.

Using the app, we hope to provide a way to quickly and efficiently broadcast a message to nearby passerbys that user in the immediate vicinity is in an emergency and if they can provide help, the app will guide them through the steps to help the user.

The application is being currently developed as a native Android application with plans in the future to make it more accessible.
